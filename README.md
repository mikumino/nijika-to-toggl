# nijika-to-toggl
Converts Nijika logs to Toggl Track entries

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python main.py`
4. Follow the prompts and yay yay now you have a CSV that you can import

## Limitations

- Will not attempt to merge existing Toggl entries with Nijika logs. If you have Toggl entries already, they will stay as-is.
- Probably others idk lol
